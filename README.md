# Biblical atlas

It is a personal project to search biblical places on maps

It is based in [See the Good Land](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/library/r1/lp-e/all-publications/brochures-and-booklets/good-land-gl). This publication is edited by Jehova's witnesses

To see this project running, please visit this [page](https://toronacii.github.io/biblical-atlas/)
